# BallotBox: Bitcoin Funding

## Introduction

Generally speaking, there are two personas: the user and the DAO admin.

### As a DAO admin
- I want to to collect BTC from multiple people
- I want to be able to add 1 or more Bitcoin addresses to my DAO (for collecting funds) 
- The money collected must be native BTC sent from a native BTC address (including Coinbase) to a BTC address (electrum, Casa, Trezor, etc) 
- I want to set an end date for my campaign (optional)
- I want the DAO to issue governance rights to members 
- I want to see all transactions in/out of the DAO’s wallet listed publicly 
- I want to promote decentralization wherever possible 

### As a user 
- I want to send BTC from any BTC wallet to the DAO 
- I want governance rights of the DAO 
- I want to see all transactions in/out of the DAO’s wallet listed publicly 

### Main problems to solve
- You want DAO funds to raise as much money as possible 
- Make it as easy as possible to fund BTC and not connect their wallets 
- Easiest step should be sending BTC 
- Connecting their Hiro Wallet

### Roles: 
- Normal user: Fund the DAO 
- Power user: Funds + Govern the DAO
